# WebBiometricsDemo

In this project, I looked at integrating biometric authentication with Angular using WebAuthn. 
We covered the basics, from understanding key WebAuthn objects like PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions and PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions 
to configuring Angular services and UI components for a seamless sign-up and sign-in process.

Using biometric authentication not only improves security, it also simplifies the user experience, 
paving the way for a future where signing in is as easy as scanning your fingerprint or quickly recognizing your face. 
By integrating these features into your Angular apps, youâ€™ll contribute to a more secure and user-friendly web. Happy coding!
